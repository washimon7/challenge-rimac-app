# Getting Started with Challenge Rimac App

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).\
It allows the development team to hot reload in just three commands.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000] or (http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Programming Languages

TypeScript was used for the development of the application.

## Technologies used

HTML and all its semantic tags were used for the structure of the web pages.\
CSS and the SASS preprocessor were used for the layout of the views of the web pages.\
Redux was used to manage the state of the application, since it allows information\
to be managed in an orderly, secure and scalable way.
